To build the toolkit, first run (read it first! so you see what is being installed)

```sudo bash setup_gentle_toolkit.sh```

This should build and install everything that is needed.

If build is successful, try the following commands (files are also stored here for convenience)

wget https://aacapps.com/lamp/sound/eric.mp3
echo "Hi, I'm Eric, one of the available high quality text to speech voices. Select download now to install my voice." >> eric.txt
python gentle/align.py eric.mp3 eric.txt > out.json

The `align_many.py` script can do alignment of many files, it takes 3 arguments - the input wavs, the input txts, and the desired output dir. For example:

```python align_many.py /Tmp/kastner/lj_speech/LJSpeech-1.0/wavs/ /Tmp/kastner/lj_speech/LJSpeech-1.0/txts/ /Tmp/kastner/lj_speech/LJSpeech-1.0/gentle_json```

Extra info:

The full run_alignment.sh script needs 2 directories, "raw_txt" and "wav", where fname.wav and fname.txt are matched pairs of audio, text content

It will run over all files, collecting word statistics and helping do some common cleanup. This was tested on a scraped dataset of political speeches, so it may not generalize to other data.

`bash -x run_alignment.sh` is recommended to see intermediate activity.
